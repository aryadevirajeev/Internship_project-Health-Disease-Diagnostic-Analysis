### Project Overview  
Health is the real wealth.In the pandemic time we all realized the brute effects of covid-19 on all irrespective of any status. A health dataset is provided for analysing the medical condition of people, for the preperation of future such pandemic. It is always best to analyse the health and medical data for better future prepeartion.  
The stakeholders wants to do ETL(Extract-Transform Load) data from the heart disease diagnostic database.  
The EDA(Exploratory Data Analysis) is expected to be performed by python.   
The analyst needs to compare attributes of the data set to extract necessary information.It is required to find key metrics and factors and show meaningful relationships between attributes.  
### Data Source  
The data is in the form of  a .csv file.  
The database consists of various informations such as Heart disease rates, Heart disease by gender, by age.  
#### Tools  
- Python - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

### Results  
- Over 50% of the sample population is affected by heart disease
- Among the four chest pain types-**typical angina** is 48.43%, **non-anginal** is 27.6%, **atypical angina** is 16.4%, **asymptomatic** is 7.56%
- When considering cholesterol level 51% have **High cholesterol**,31.1% have **Borderline cholesterol**,16.5% have **Normal cholesterol**
- From the visuls, there is a correlation identified between cholesterol and heart disease. 45.7% of those with high cholesterol and 58.6% of those with normal cholesterol have heart disease.
- **Resting ECG** and **Exercise Angina** are combined indicators of heart health
- Normal Resting ECG can still show Exercise Angina, indicating potential **underlying heart issues**
- **Left Ventricular Hypertrophy**: Both Resting ECG and Exercise Angina typically show abnormalities
- Fixed and Reversible defects(**Thalassemia Patients**) are also detected with heart disease
- Higher cholesterol and borderline blood pressure level are common in Thalassemia Patients
- Males are more frequently diagnosed with heart disease comapring females
- Majority heart patients fall within older and middle-aged categories
### Recommendation  
Maintaining good health is crucial for surviving a pandemic. Regularly checking cholesterol, blood pressure, and heart function is essential.
